# American-Alphabet-Signs
Inspired by the deeplearning specialization course 4  Convolutional Neural Network  week1 [assignment](https://github.com/amanchadha/coursera-deep-learning-specialization/blob/master/C4%20-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/Week%201/Convolution_model_Application_2024.ipynb)
I create a project to detect the American Alphabets Sings

## [DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet/data)
The data set is a collection of images of alphabets from the American Sign Language, separated in 29 folders which represent the various classes.

#### Content
The training data set contains 87,000 images which are 200x200 pixels. There are 29 classes, of which 26 are for the letters A-Z and 3 classes for SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING.
These 3 classes are very helpful in real-time applications, and classification.
The test data set contains a mere 29 images, to encourage the use of real-world test images
